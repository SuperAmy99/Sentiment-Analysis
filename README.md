# Exploring Emotions in Tweets: A Sentiment Analysis Project

## Introduction

Sentiment Analysis is a technique that leverages data analysis to uncover the emotional tone behind text data. In this project, we explore the world of sentiment analysis and its real-world applications.

## Why do we need sentiment analysis?

Sentiment analysis offers real-time insights with applications in various sectors such as business, politics, and social research. It aids in decision-making and provides valuable predictive capabilities.

## Project Overview

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that covers the entire process of Twitter sentiment analysis, starting from data collection and preprocessing, model building, creating a dashboard, and finally deploying the model and dashboard as an online application.

You can read the comprehensive guide (including code walkthroughs) to understand the detailed implementation of each phase of the project.

### Data Collection

For this project, we utilized a public dataset from Kaggle. You can access the dataset using the following link:

[Kaggle Sentiment140 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/data)

### Behind the Scenes: Data to Decisions

#### Data Collection

- Explain the sources of data, including the public dataset from Kaggle and real-time tweets from an API.

#### Preprocessing and Model Selection

- Detail the steps involved in preprocessing the text data.
- Mention the machine learning models you tested (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM).
- Explain why Logistic Regression was chosen as the best model.
- Describe the hyperparameter tuning process.

#### Streamlit Application

- Discuss the development of the Streamlit application for sentiment analysis.
- Explain how the app visually presents sentiments in tweets and its practical value.

## Case Studies

Provide examples of case studies using the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer:

### Case Study 1: 'iPhone'

- Explain how the application analyzes sentiment around the keyword 'iPhone.'
- Share the insights gained from analyzing the data, including the negative sentiments and specific issues identified.

### Case Study 2: 'racist'

- Describe the sentiment analysis applied to the keyword 'racist.'
- Highlight the positive sentiment percentage and the insights gained regarding societal opinions.

## Limitations and Insights

- Discuss the limitations encountered during the project, including the lack of real-time data and the model's ability to handle neutral tweets.
- Address the language barrier limitation, restricting the analysis to English content.
  
## Conclusion

Summarize the key findings and the project's significance in understanding public opinion and its applications in strategy-making.

## Future Enhancements

Discuss potential future improvements and extensions to the project, such as handling complex expressions and supporting multiple languages.
