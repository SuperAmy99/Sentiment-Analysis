## Introduction

Sentiment Analysis leverages data analysis techniques to interpret the emotional tone behind text data. This project delves into sentiment analysis within the context of Twitter, a platform rich in opinion and sentiment, demonstrating its real-world applications and impact.

## Project Overview

This end-to-end machine learning project encompasses the full spectrum of Twitter sentiment analysis, from data collection and text cleaning to modeling, visualization, and presentation, providing a comprehensive view of the sentiment analysis process.

## Data Collection

### Kaggle Dataset
The project uses the Kaggle Sentiment140 Dataset, a rich collection of historical tweets, chosen for its diversity and relevance. Access it here: [Kaggle Sentiment140 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/data).

### Scraper API
Real-time tweets were gathered using the [Scraper API](https://dashboard.scraperapi.com/), enabling access to current Twitter sentiments. This dynamic data source offered a real-time perspective on public opinion.

## Data Modeling

### Text Preprocessing
Key steps included noise removal, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal, each crucial for preparing the text for analysis.

### Machine Learning Models
The project evaluated Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM, chosen for their effectiveness in text classification tasks.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Focused on optimizing the Logistic Regression model, this phase involved adjusting parameters to enhance model accuracy and performance.

### Notebook
